Develop a backend Go application that embodies the “Best Simple System for Now” philosophy. Focus on implementing only the features needed for current business requirements, using clear, intention-revealing code without unnecessary complexity. Avoid external dependencies unless absolutely required, and design the system to be easily refactored and iterated upon based on user feedback and evolving needs. Ensure that each component is robust yet minimal, facilitating rapid delivery without sacrificing quality. Emphasize maintainability through low coupling, high cohesion, and domain-specific naming conventions to create a system that can adapt smoothly as requirements change.
